# WEAPON FINGERPRINTS
**This resource is currently WIP**

## ðŸ“œ Description
This script saves the players fingerprint on a weapon they hold via metadata. The fingerprints can be "washed off" and falsely manipulated. Also you won't put any fingerprints on it if you are wearing gloves.

## ðŸ¤– Exports
Client:
- IsPlayersFingerprintInserted: fun(metadata: table): boolean
- IsPlayersFingerprintOnCurrentWeapon: fun(): booolean

Server:
- AddFingerprint: fun(playerId: number, slot: number, identifier: string)
- RemoveFingerprint: fun(playerId: number, slot: number, identifier: string)
- PurgeFingerprints: fun(playerId: number, slot, number)
- GetFingerprints: fun(playerId: number, slot: number): string[] identifiers
